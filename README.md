# E-Commerce Web App

Welcome to our E-Commerce Web App, a dynamic online shopping platform built with a modern tech stack. Below, we outline the key technologies that power this project:

## Tech Stack

- **React**: The core of our web app. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, making our app interactive and responsive.

- **React Router**: For seamless client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different pages within our app.

- **Axios**: Axios simplifies data fetching by making HTTP requests to external APIs, allowing us to retrieve product information and more.

- **Tailwind CSS**: We've styled our app using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to ensure a consistent and responsive design.

- **React Query**: This library is employed for efficient data fetching and state management, improving our app's performance and providing a seamless user experience.

- **Netlify**: Our app is deployed and hosted on Netlify, providing fast, scalable, and secure hosting for static websites and applications.
